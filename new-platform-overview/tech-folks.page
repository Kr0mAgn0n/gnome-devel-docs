<title>Folks</title>

  <p>
    Various systems have different representations for user accounts.  For
    example, <link xref="eds">Evolution Data Server</link> has the user's
    list of email contacts.  <link xref="telepathy">Telepathy</link> has the user's
    list of instant-messaging contacts.  Various web services have the user's
    "friends".  Libfolks takes care of aggregating all these forms of contacts
    so that you can get all the accounts that belong to one person.  This lets
    software present lists of people in a more useful fashion, instead of
    showing duplicated people whenever they have more than one account
    associated to them.

  <p>
    In GNOME, Empathy (the instant messaging client) uses Folks to present a
    unified view of people ("Person X has these IM accounts"), rather than
    disparate accounts for the same person ("Person X at AIM, Person X at
    GTalk, Person X at Yahoo! Messenger").
