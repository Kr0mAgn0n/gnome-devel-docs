This module contains high-level developer documentation that cannot
reasonably be shipped with any other module.  Developers are taken
in the broadest sense to mean anybody involved in the production
of software, including programmers, technical writers, translators,
quality assurance professionals, and project managers.

All of the documents in this module should be long-term maintainable.
This is not the place for technology previews, product reviews, or
calls to action.  Consider publishing such documents in the excellent
GNOME Journal.

Each document may be maintained by somebody other than the module
maintainers.  Document maintainers should make a commitment to have
their documents finalized in time for each stable GNOME release.
Document maintainers may create branches for longer-term document
development or restructuring.

This module is for Free documentation.  Please contact the maintainers
before committing any documentation which is not under the GNU FDL.
