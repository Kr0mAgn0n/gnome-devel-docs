  <title>Testing Icons</title>
  <para>Icons are a graphical metaphor presenting a visual image that the user associates with a particular object, state or operation. When a user sees a good icon they are immediately reminded of the item it represents, whether that be an application in the panel menu or the "right aligned" state in a word processor toolbar.</para>

      <listitem><para>Icons can assist the user in rapidly scanning a large number of objects to select the desired item. Particularly after a user is acustomed to an icon's appearance, they can identify it more rapidly than a text label.</para></listitem>

    <title>Style</title>
    
    <para>GNOME uses a soft, three-dimensional look. This style is achieved by using antialiasing, shading and highlighting techniques. The <ulink url="http://www.ximian.com/devzone/tutorials/icon-design/"><citetitle>Gnome Icons</citetitle></ulink> tutorial details how one of GNOME's leading artists creates some of these effects.</para>
    <para>Components of an icon style can be broken down into several categories such as perspective, dimentionality, lighting effects and palette. These components play an important part in giving a group of icons a collectively distinctive look. For instance, the Java Look and Feel is recognizable by its use of a primary eight-color palette, interior highlighting and diagonal gradients. The Macintosh Aqua style is recognizable by its use of a cool palette based on blue, lighting effects mimicking reflectivity and antialiasing. The GNOME style exhibits a subdued thirty-two color palette, soft drop shadows and a mix between cartoonish and photorealistic graphics.</para>

      <title>Document Icons</title>
      <para>If possible, document icons should convey the type of the file using a physical object. For example a good icon for MPEG video would be a movie reel. Failing the existence of an appropriate object, when a document type corresponds to a specific application, another option is to use a piece of paper with the corresponding application's icon overlayed it as the document icon. This may be appropriate for a document type such as an application's settings files.</para>
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para>Do <emphasis>not</emphasis> display a piece of paper behind a document icon unless the document type has a use correspondence with physical paper (or a suitable object was not found and you are using the application icon). For example, the final state of most word processing documents is a piece of paper, so it is appropriate to use a piece of paper in the icon. On the other hand, a movie on the computer has little association with a piece of paper, so a piece of paper behind the movie reel primarily introduces <link linkend="icon_problems_extraneous_information">visual noise</link>. The use of a piece of paper in most or all document types creates an additional problem: it is harder to scan large numbers of icons because they do not possess <link linkend="icon_design_silhouettes">distinct outlines</link>. A useful technique for creating a subtle difference between document types with similar roles (for example, between "JPEG", "PNG", "GIF", etc) is to use different colours. Expert users who need to make this distinction frequently will become accustomed to these differences.</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>Do <emphasis>not</emphasis> include a file extension in the icon. The document icon's job is not to convey such precise information but to allow for rapid visual distinction between documents. Additionally, this text will not be displayed in the user's preferred font and size. Because many document types are associated with multiple file extensions, a file extension embedded in the icon will also frequently be wrong. In a context where the file extension is actually useful, the application should composite the information onto the icon at runtime (thereby using the correct font and size, as well as getting the extension right).</para></listitem>

    <!-- CB-Ed: Much of this section has good substance, but is communicated poorly.  There seem to be a lot of blanket statements, and the tone is subjective (e.g., text describing figure 12, the Gnumeric icon.  Stick just to the facts, or try to stay closely to objective language, and language that will not be presenting things in a way that can be argued with or questioned. -->
    <!-- Seth: Objective language does not present the entire picture. While its better for laying down hard and fast guidelines, it does not assist designers in understanding the motivation behind various decisions. This document covers the design *philosophy* as well as providing specific guidelines. This is in fact one of my major complaints about the Java guidelines relative to the MacOS guidelines. Java guidelines attempt to maintain a facade of scientific objectivity and in doing so fail to educate designers as well as failing to communicate the real dynamics of good design. Dealing with more subjective issues is particularly important because many of the readers of the GNOME guidelines will not be professional icon artists, or even graphic designers. -->

	    <title>Avoid name suggestive icons</title>
	    <para>Some icons, such as the Nautilus icon, do not suggest the program's purpose, but instead suggest the program's name. This is less desirable than a functionally suggestive icon, because an extra layer of abstraction is added (rather than associating file management with an icon representing files, they have to associate file management with nautilus with an image of a nautilus shell). Additionally it makes it difficult for new users who may not know what "Nautilus" is, and hence will not recognize a shell icon as the file manager.</para>

	    <para>Icons which contain the text of the program name in the icon. They effectively contain no metaphor or picture for the user to identify with, and are probably harder to read than the accompanying caption. Since icons draw the eyes, an icon that is harder to identify than text is potentially worse than no icon at all. Hence "text icons" should not be used. Moreover, text should be avoided in icons because it makes the icons difficult to translate. If there is text in icons it should not form words in your native language, a good metric for ensuring that the particular text is not lending to the meaning of the icon.</para>

	    <para>Remember that icons will often be viewed in a smaller form. Too much information may render the icon unintelligable when it is shrunk in size (e.g. to be placed on a panel, or in the tasklist). Too much information also makes it easier for users confuse the purpose of the application. For example, in user testing many users thought the Evolution icon would launch a word processor. They were misled by the pencil and the paper, which could be seen as extraneous information: it is implicit that the mail program will allow you to write messages as well as receive them. A better icon might have been a simple envelope. Foremost in the icon designer's mind should be a consideration of the minimal visual elements necessary to express the purpose of the program.</para>

	    The Gnumeric icon is a great icon except for the introduction of extra visual noise. The extra sheet of paper with the 'g' on it behind the spreadsheet and chart adds no significant value to the icon and provides extra visual distraction. In this case the contribution of the extraneous element to the appearance of the icon is negative. Simple well balanced icons look more attractive than cluttered icons. An improved icon might contain only the spreadsheet and chart; larger because they can use all of the space in the icon, and hence more visually distinct.

	    <title>Do <emphasis>not</emphasis> include body parts in the icon</title>
	    <para> Because GNOME aims to be an international desktop, it needs to avoid imagery that is potentially offensive or crass to other cultures. A prime source of offensive imagery is various body parts in a number of different configurations. Aside from offensive gestures with the hands, arms or fingers; body parts that are considered "clean" in one culture (such as eyes), will be considered tasteless or gross to another (such as a nose). Based on a survey of icons in GNOME, body parts frequently appear in the least communicative icons (often "pointing" at some element in the icon); they are being used as an ineffective crutch for poor metaphor. In these situations body parts should <emphasis>not</emphasis> be used. Even in situations where the metaphor is appropriate (for example an eye representing the sawfish appearance capplet) it is better to avoid using a body part. Often body parts have been used in GNOME to suggest a human "choosing" or "using" something. This is normally an unnecessary point for the icon designer to make. People naturally attempt to understand objects in reference to themselves (show someone a bat and they will think of hitting something with the bat, show someone a tool and they will think of using it, etc). For example, the font selector shows a finger pointing to an "F" suggesting the user choosing between a series of fonts. A better icon would be the text "Aa" presented in an ornate font (calling attention to the font rather than the text). The user doesn't need to be told that they are "choosing" the font, they can infer that easily.</para>

	    <title>Do <emphasis>not</emphasis> base icons off word puns</title>
	      <para>This should be avoided for a couple reasons, the most obvious of which is that puns do not translate well. For example, representing the "system log monitor" as a log will likely be uncommunicative in languages other than English. Additionally, most users do not comprehend the word play until it is too late for the icon to assist them. Even after being familiar with the "system log monitor" being represented as a log, users do not form the association fast enough for the icon to assist through in scanning through menu entries. A popular instance of this problem was the proliferation of icons representing the "World Wide Web" as a spider web in the mid 1990s. Part of the value of icons is that they bypass linguistic comprehension and hence are complementary to captions, allowing users to utilize more areas of the mind than linguistic recognition (already used in scanning for captions) when they hunt for items.</para>

	    <title>Do <emphasis>not</emphasis> employ violent imagery</title>
	    <para>Just as words like "kill" and "slay" are inappropriate in interfaces, violent or destructive icons should be avoided. The "shut down" icon uses the image of an explosive detonation switch, presumably trying to convey the idea of ending something abruptly. However, this icon is likely to intimidate some users of the computer who will not want to click on the icon for fear of breaking something.</para>
