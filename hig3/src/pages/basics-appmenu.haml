  When to use
%p
  Any GNOME 3 application that features windows should incorporate an application menu. 

%h2Guidance
%p
  The application menu is the primary way to provide access to application-wide actions and configuration options. A focused and well-designed application will typically not need any menus other than the application menu.

%ul
  %li
    When determining what to include in your application menu, follow the standard design guidance for
    =link "menus", "component-menu.html"
    \.
  %li
    You can use the full range of menu features in an application menu, including check boxes, radio buttons and submenus.
  %li
    Include those actions and options that relate to the application as a whole, including application-wide configuration options and actions that are not specific to a particular window or piece of content. For multi-window applications, this means that menu items should not affect individual windows. 
  %li
    Be consistent with other GNOME 3 applications when selecting which items to include in your application menu. Items that should be placed in the application menu if they are available include:
    
    %ul
      %li
        New Window
      %li
        Fullscreen
      %li
        =link "Preferences",  "other_preferences.html"
      %li
        Help
      %li
        About
  %li
    New Window should always be placed at the top of the menu.
  %li
    Preferences, Help and About items should always be grouped together at the bottom.
  %li
    Every application menu should include an About entry.
