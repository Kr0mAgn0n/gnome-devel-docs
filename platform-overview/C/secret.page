<title>Secret</title>

<p>GNOME uses libsecret as a secure keyring manager, to store users'
passwords and other sensitive data.  Applications can use the keyring
manager library to store and access passwords, and users can manage
their passwords using GNOME's <app>Seahorse</app>
application.</p>

<p>The keyring manager provides any number of keyrings, where each
keyring can contain any number of keyring items.  Items in a keyring
store some piece of data, often a password.  Each keyring is locked
individually, and users must provide a password to unlock the keyring.
Once a keyring has been unlocked, the user has access to all of the
items in that keyring.</p>

<p>The keyring manager provides access control lists for each keyring
item, controlling which applications are allowed access to that item.
If an unknown application attempts to access a keyring item, the keyring
manager will prompt the user to allow or deny that application access.
This helps prevent malicious or poorly-written programs from accessing
the user's sensitive data.</p>

<p>Keyring data stored on the file system is encrypted with the AES
block cipher, and SHA1 is used for hashes of the item's attributes.
Using the attributes hash, the keyring manager is able to look up items
requested by applications without ever unlocking the keyring.  The
keyring has to be unlocked when a matching item is found and
accessed.</p>

<p>The keyring manager also provides a session keyring.  Items in
the session keyring are never stored on disk, and are lost as soon as
the user's session ends.  The session keyring can be used to store
passwords to be used in the current session only.</p>

<p>If you use <link xref="gio">GIO</link> to access remote servers, you automatically
get the benefits of the keyring manager.  Whenever GIO needs to
authenticate the user, it provides the option to store the password,
either in the default keyring or in the session keyring.</p>

<p>You should use libsecret's keyring manager whenever your application needs
to store passwords or other sensitive data for users.  Using the keyring
manager provides a better user experience while still keeping user data
safe and secure.</p>

  <note>
    <p>
      Gnome used a library called gnome-keyring before version 3.6 was
      released.  In version 3.6 onward, libsecret is used instead.  This allows
      sharing the keyring servide between GNOME and other desktop environments
      and applications.
