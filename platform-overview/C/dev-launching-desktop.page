  <title>Install a desktop file</title>

  <p>Write and install a desktop file so that users can discover and launch
  your application.</p>
  
  <p>GNOME uses the <link type="seealso" href="http://standards.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/index.html">freedesktop.org
  Desktop Entry</link> and <link type="seealso" href="http://standards.freedesktop.org/desktop-menu-spec/latest/index.html">Desktop
  Menu specifications</link> to describe application launchers. Installing a
  desktop file is the standard way to register your application with GNOME and
  other desktops.</p>
  
  <p>A desktop file lists your application binary, name and type, and can also
  list an icon, description and several other pieces of information about
  launching an application.</p>

  <p>For a hypothetical application <app>My Application</app>, a desktop file
  would look as follows:</p>
  <example>
    <listing>
      <title><file>myapplication.desktop</file></title>
<code>[Desktop Entry]
Name=My Application
Exec=myapplication
Type=Application
Icon=myapplication
Comment=Do the thing that the application does
Categories=GTK;GNOME;Utility;</code>
    </listing>
  </example>

  <p>The <code>[Desktop Entry]</code> line indicates that this is a desktop
  file. It is followed by keys, which describe the application launcher. The
  <code>Name</code> key is the human-readable name of the application, to be
  shown in the UI. The application binary is listed in the <code>Exec</code>
  key, either the complete path or a binary that is looked up in the
  <code>PATH</code>. The last required key is the <code>Type</code>, which for
  applications is always <code>Application</code>. Alternative types are listed
  in the desktop entry specification.</p>

  <p>Other fields in the desktop file are optional, but recommended.
  Applications should install an icon, and list the name of the icon (excluding
  the extension) in the <code>Icon</code> key. The <code>Comment</code> is a
  brief description of the application. To help users when browsing
  applications, the <code>Categories</code> key should be populated with a
  list of categories, separated by a semicolon, from the Desktop Menu
  Specification.</p>

  <p>There are several other keys that can be added to desktop files, which are
  listed and described in the Desktop Entry Specification.</p>
