"Because GNOME aims to be an international desktop, it needs to avoid imagery "

"fingers; body parts that are considered \"clean\" in one culture (such as "
"eyes), will be considered tasteless or gross to another (such as a nose). "
"Based on a survey of icons in GNOME, body parts frequently appear in the "
"least communicative icons (often \"pointing\" at some element in the icon); "
"they are being used as an ineffective crutch for poor metaphor. In these "
"situations body parts should <emphasis>not</emphasis> be used. Even in "
"situations where the metaphor is appropriate (for example an eye "

"\"choosing\" or \"using\" something. This is normally an unnecessary point "
"for the icon designer to make. People naturally attempt to understand "
"objects in reference to themselves (show someone a bat and they will think "
"of hitting something with the bat, show someone a tool and they will think "
"of using it, etc). For example, the font selector shows a finger pointing to "
"an \"F\" suggesting the user choosing between a series of fonts. A better "

"Components of an icon style can be broken down into several categories such "

"components play an important part in giving a group of icons a collectively "
"distinctive look. For instance, the Java Look and Feel, or \"metal,\" is "
