"Because GNOME aims to be an international desktop, it needs to avoid imagery "

"eyes), will be considered tasteless or gross to another (such as a nose). "
"Based on a survey of icons in GNOME, body parts frequently appear in the "

"they are being used as an ineffective crutch for poor metaphor. In these "
"situations body parts should <emphasis>not</emphasis> be used. Even in "
"situations where the metaphor is appropriate (for example an eye "

"body part. Often body parts have been used in GNOME to suggest a human "
"\"choosing\" or \"using\" something. This is normally an unnecessary point "
"for the icon designer to make. People naturally attempt to understand "
"objects in reference to themselves (show someone a bat and they will think "
"of hitting something with the bat, show someone a tool and they will think "
"of using it, etc). For example, the font selector shows a finger pointing to "
"an \"F\" suggesting the user choosing between a series of fonts. A better "

#. Consensus was against giving OK and Cancel additional access keys, but they have them anyway and Owen refuses to remove them...
#.
#. 	<note>
#. 	  <title>For discussion</title>
#. 	  <para>It's been suggested that even OK and Cancel should have access keys, as this is more obvious to newer users.  (KDE does this).  What do we think?  Advantages: means you do not always have to have an Enter-operated default button in dialogs where this might lead you to close the dialog by mistake.  Disadvantages: Adds an extra way for people to do things, potentially adding the "dither" factor; uses up O and C access keys, which could be awkward in larger/tabbed dialogs.</para>
