"This should be avoided for a couple reasons, the most obvious of which is "
"that puns do not translate well. For example, representing the \"system log "
"monitor\" as a log will likely be uncommunicative in languages other than "
"English. Additionally, most users do not comprehend the word play until it "
"is too late for the icon to assist them. Even after being familiar with the "
"\"system log monitor\" being represented as a log, users do not form the "
"association fast enough for the icon to assist through in scanning through "
"menu entries. A popular instance of this problem was the proliferation of "
"icons representing the \"World Wide Web\" as a spider web in the mid 1990s. "
"Part of the value of icons is that they bypass linguistic comprehension and "
"hence are complementary to captions, allowing users to utilize more areas of "
"the mind than linguistic recognition (already used in scanning for captions) "
"when they hunt for items."
