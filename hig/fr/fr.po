#. 	<note>
#. 	  <title>For discussion</title>
#. 	  <para>It's been suggested that even OK and Cancel should have access keys, as this is more obvious to newer users.  (KDE does this).  What do we think?  Advantages: means you do not always have to have an Enter-operated default button in dialogs where this might lead you to close the dialog by mistake.  Disadvantages: Adds an extra way for people to do things, potentially adding the "dither" factor; uses up O and C access keys, which could be awkward in larger/tabbed dialogs.</para>
