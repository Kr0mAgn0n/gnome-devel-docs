    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>
      This document tells you how to create applications that look right,
      behave properly, and fit into the GNOME user interface as a whole. It
      is written for interface designers, graphic artists and software
      developers who will be creating software for the GNOME environment.
      Both specific advice on making effective use of interface elements,
      and the philosophy and general design principles behind the GNOME
      interface are covered.
    </para>
    <para><phrase revisionflag="changed">
      These guidelines are meant to help you design and write applications 
      that are
      easy to use and consistent with the GNOME desktop. Following these
      guidelines will have many benefits:
      </phrase><itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para>Users will learn to use your
	program faster, because interface elements will look and
	behave the way they are used to.</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>Novice and advanced users alike will be able
	accomplish tasks quickly and easily, because the interface
	won't be confusing or make things difficult.</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>Your application will have an attractive look
	that fits in with the rest of the desktop.</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>Your application will continue to look
	good when users change desktop themes, fonts and
	colors.</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>Your application will be accessible to all
	users, including those with disabilities or special
	needs.</para></listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </para>
    <para>
      To help you achieve these goals, these guidelines will cover basic
      interface elements, how to use them and put them together effectively,
      and how to make your application integrate well with the desktop.
    </para>
    <para>
      The recommendations here build on design aspects that have
      worked well in other systems, including Mac OS, Windows, Java
      and KDE. At the same time they retain a uniquely GNOME flavor.

  <chapter id="principles">
    
    <title>Usability Principles</title>

    <para>This section explains some of the basic principles behind the more specific technical guidelines recommended in this document.  We believe that these principles are important for all application development.</para>

    <sect1 id="principles-people">
      <title>Design for People</title>

      <para>Remember that the purpose of any software application is to enable some group of people to accomplish a specific set of tasks.  So, the first things to establish when designing your application are:</para>

	<orderedlist>
		<listitem><para>who your users are</para></listitem>
		<listitem><para>what you want to enable them to do</para></listitem>
	</orderedlist>

      <para>For example, you may be designing an application that will enable engineers (software, electrical, or mechanical) to create diagrams.  You may be designing an application that will enable system administrators to configure and monitor a web server.  You may be designing an application that will help elementary school students to learn math.</para>

      <para><phrase revisionflag="changed">The important thing is that you know your audience, and you understand both their goals and the tasks necessary to achieve those goals.  There are a large number of professional interaction designers who write books and teach courses on design methods that can help with this process, many of which are extremely useful</phrase>—<phrase revisionflag="added"> see the </phrase><xref linkend="bibliography"/><phrase revisionflag="added"> for a selection.  Most of these methods, however, boil down to specific ways of understanding your users, understanding the tasks you want to help them accomplish, and finding ways to support those tasks in your application.</phrase></para>

    </sect1><phrase revisionflag="deleted">FUTURE: We ought to have a bibliography to point people to some of these "extremely useful" texts --Calum.</phrase>
    <sect1 id="principles-broad-userbase">
      <title>Don't Limit Your User Base</title>

      <para>If you are designing an application for use by engineers, or by children, or by system administrators, be sure to create an application that can be used by <emphasis>all</emphasis> engineers, children, or system administrators, including those with disabilities or those who are native speakers of a language different from yours.  Be aware of accessibility issues and internationalization and localization issues, many of which are addressed by the guidelines in this document.</para>

      <sect2 id="accessibility">
	<title>Accessibility</title>

	<para><phrase revisionflag="changed">Accessibility (sometimes called </phrase><emphasis revisionflag="added">a11y</emphasis><phrase revisionflag="added">) means enabling people with disabilities of some kind to participate in life's activities: in this case, specifically to use your software.  For example:</phrase></para>

	<itemizedlist>
		<listitem><para>Color-blind users may not be able to use your application if you rely only on color-coding to distinguish different types of information</para></listitem>
		<listitem><para>Users with hearing impairments may not be able to use your application if you rely on sounds to indicate critical information</para></listitem>
		<listitem><para>Users with limited movement may not be able to use your application if you don't provide keyboard equivalents for commands</para></listitem>
	</itemizedlist>

	<para>Your software should also be usable with voice interfaces, screen readers such as <ulink url="http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gap/AT/Gnopernicus/index.html" revisionflag="changed">Gnopernicus</ulink>, alternate input devices, and other assistive technologies.  The standard GNOME libraries do most of this work for you, but with a little extra effort you can make your application every bit as useful to users who rely on those technologies as to those who don't.</para>

	<para><phrase revisionflag="changed">GNOME has excellent inbuilt support for accessibility by means of the ATK and GAIL libraries, which in many cases can do most of the work for you. More information on accessibility in GNOME can be found at the </phrase><ulink url="http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gap/">GNOME Accessibility Project</ulink>.</para>

      </sect2>
      <sect2 id="internationalization">
	<title>Internationalization and Localization</title>

	<para revisionflag="changed">Internationalization means designing software so that it can function in different language environments.  Localization is the process of actually translating the messages, labels, and other interface elements of an application into another language.</para>

	<para><phrase revisionflag="changed">GNOME has excellent support for both internationalization (also referred to as i18n) and localization (also referred to as l10n).  In most cases, simply using standard GNOME APIs for displaying text and messages will allow you or others to localize your application for other locales.  For more information on how to make your application localizable, see the </phrase><ulink url="http://www.pango.org">Pango project home page</ulink> (Pango is the GNOME library for rendering internationalized text), the <ulink url="http://www.gnome.org/i18n/">GNOME Translations page</ulink>, and the <ulink url="http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gtp/">GNOME Translation Project page</ulink>.</para>
	
	<para revisionflag="added">Sensitivity to cultural and political issues is also an important consideration. Designing icons and sounds, and even choosing colors requires some understanding of the connotations they might have to a user from a different part of the world.</para>
	<para revisionflag="added">Examples of elements it is best to avoid for these reasons include:</para>
	<itemizedlist>
		<listitem><para revisionflag="added">Pictures of flags or money</para></listitem>
		<listitem><para revisionflag="added">Maps showing political boundaries or contentious location names</para></listitem>
		<listitem><para revisionflag="added">Lists of countries or cities in non-alphabetical order (unless specifically requested or required by the context)</para></listitem> 
		<listitem><para revisionflag="added">Icons depicting animals</para></listitem>
		<listitem><para revisionflag="added">Icons depicting only hands or feet</para></listitem>
	</itemizedlist>

      </sect2>
    
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="principles-match">
      <title>Create a Match Between Your Application and the Real World</title>

      <para id="use-users-language">Always use words, phrases, and concepts that are familiar to the user rather than terms from the underlying system.  Use terms that relate to the user's knowledge of the tasks your application supports.  For example, in medicine, the paper folder that contains all information about a specific patient is called a "chart."  Hence, a medical application might refer to a patient record that contains the same information as a paper chart as a "patient chart" rather than as a "patient database record."</para>

      <para>You can often take advantage of your users' knowledge of the real world by using metaphor— that is, a familiar concept from the outside world— to represent elements within your application.  For example:</para>

	<itemizedlist>
		<listitem><para>an image of a file folder suggests a container into which documents can be placed</para></listitem>
		<listitem><para>a waste basket suggests a container into which items can be placed when they are no longer needed</para></listitem>
	</itemizedlist>

      <para>When using metaphors, however, it is important to neither take the metaphor too literally, nor to extend the metaphor beyond its reasonable use.  For example, the capacity of a file folder should not be limited to the capacity of a physical file folder, which presumably could contain only a few documents before becoming unwieldy.  On the other hand, a waste basket should not be used for anything other than holding discarded files.  It should not be used, for example, to eject a removable disk such as a floppy or CD.</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="principles-consistency">
      <title>Make Your Application Consistent</title>

      <para>Make your application consistent with itself and with other applications, in both its appearance and its behavior. This is one of the most important design principles, and probably the most famous, but it is also frequently ignored. While this document serves as the basis for consistency between GNOME applications, you are encouraged to look at and follow other application's conventions where this document provides no guidelines.</para>

      <para>Consistency enables users to apply their existing knowledge of their computing environment and other applications to understanding a new application.  This not only allows users to become familiar with new applications more quickly, but also helps create a sense of comfort and trust in the overall environment.  Most of the recommendations in the GNOME HI Guidelines are designed to help you create applications that are consistent with the GNOME environment and other GNOME applications.</para>

      <para>A word of caution: a mis-applied or incomplete consistency is often worse than inconsistency.  If your application includes an <guimenuitem>Undo</guimenuitem><phrase revisionflag="changed"> menu item for consistency, but it is always disabled because your application does not actually support Undo, this will reduce the user's trust in the availability of Undo in other applications on their desktop.  Either make your application support Undo, or eliminate the </phrase><guimenuitem>Undo</guimenuitem> menu item.</para>

    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="principles-feedback">
      <title revisionflag="changed">Keep the User Informed</title>

      <para revisionflag="changed">Always let the user know what is happening in your application by using appropriate feedback at an appropriate time.  The user should never have to guess about the status of the system or of your application.  When the user performs an action, provide feedback to indicate that the system has received the input and is operating on it. Feedback can be visual, audio, or both. If the system will take a long time to process the request, provide as much feedback as possible about how lengthy the operation will be. Types of helpful feedback include but are not limited to: cursor changes, animated "throbbers", progress indicators, audio feedback such as a beep, and error messages. Error messages should use simple language, clearly state the problem, and provide solutions or tell the user how to get out of the current situation if possible.</para>

      <para>It is critical that feedback be <emphasis>accurate</emphasis> and <emphasis>precise</emphasis>.  If you display a determinate progress indicator to display the state of completion of a task and it is inaccurate, the user will lose faith in progress indicators, and they will find the environment less usable.  If you display a generic error message that indicates that there is a problem but fails to provide enough information to diagnose or solve the problem, your users will be unable to continue with their task.</para>
      <para>See <xref linkend="feedback"/>  and <xref linkend="windows-alert"/> for more information on feedback.</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="principles-simplicity">
      <title>Keep It Simple and Pretty</title>

      <para>Your application should enable the user to concentrate on the task at hand.  So, design your application to show only useful and relevant information and interface elements.  Every extra piece of information or interface control competes with the truly relevant bits of information and distracts the user from important information.  Hence, don't clutter your interface, and don't overload the user with buttons, menu options, icons, or irrelevant information.  Instead, use progressive disclosure and other techniques to limit what the user sees at any given moment.</para>

      <para><phrase revisionflag="changed">Finally, present your information and interface elements in an aesthetically pleasing manner.  A disorganized, cluttered-looking interface with a few elements can be just as distracting as an organized interface with too much information.  Make sure that dialog elements are cleanly-aligned, and do not overuse or misuse color or graphics.  If you know a graphic designer, seek their advice if possible</phrase>—<phrase revisionflag="added"> the guidelines in this document will help you with the basics, but there is no substitute for a trained eye.</phrase></para>

	<para>See <xref linkend="design"/> and <xref linkend="icons"/> for more information on designing the visual appearance of your application.</para>

    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="principles-user-control">
      <title>Put the User in Control</title>

      <para><phrase revisionflag="changed">Remember that computers exist to serve humans.  A user should always feel in control, able to do what they want when they want.  This means you should generally avoid modes; users should be able to switch between different tasks (and specifically, different windows) at any time. See </phrase><xref linkend="window-props-modality"/><phrase revisionflag="added"> for more information on modes.</phrase></para>

      <para>The user should also be able to tailor aspects of their environment to fit personal preferences.  It is very important, however, to avoid the trap of allowing too much configuration, or allowing the configuration of parameters that most users will not understand or find useful to modify.  Wherever possible, inherit visual and behavioral parameters from global preferences and settings such as the current GTK+ theme.</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="principles-forgiveness">
      <title>Forgive the User</title>

      <para>We all make mistakes.  Whether we're exploring and learning how to use the system, or we're experts who just hit the wrong key, we are only human.  Your application should therefore allow users to quickly undo the results of their actions.</para>

      <para>If an action is very dangerous, and there is no way to undo the result, warn the user and ask for confirmation.  Only do this in extreme cases, though; if frequently faced with such confirmation messages, users begin to ignore them, making them worse than useless.</para>

      <para>In all cases, the user's work is sacrosanct.  Nothing your application does should lose or destroy user's work without explicit user action.  Among other techniques, this can be achieved by auto-saving backups of documents, and allowing multiple levels of undo.</para>

    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="principles-direct-manipulation">
      <title revisionflag="changed">Provide Direct Manipulation</title>

      <para revisionflag="changed">Wherever possible, allow users to act on objects and data directly, rather than through dialogs or explicit commands.  For example, it is more intuitive to drag a circle object around in a diagram rather than selecting a "Move" command from a menu while the circle is selected.  Simlarly, in an email application, allow the user to attach files by dragging them from the file manager and dropping them onto the message composition window if they wish.</para>

	<para>See <xref linkend="input"/> for more information on direct manipulation.</para>

      <para>Do not place version numbers, company names, or other information
      that is of no immediate use to the user in the window title. These
      consume space, making titles in limited spaces such as the system window
      list less useful, and add more text the user has to scan to find useful
      information. In a "beta" product, where version numbers are

      remove them from stable releases. Place version information in the about

    <formalpara>
      <title>Title Format</title>

      <para>Alert windows have no titles, as the title would usually
      unnecessarily duplicate the alert's primary text. This way, users
      can read and respond to alerts more quickly as there is less visual
      noise and confounding text.</para>
    </formalpara>

    <remark>Without a title, how does a screenreader user identify an alert
    window? -Calum</remark>

    <remark>The screen-reader finds out its an alert (do we need a WM
    mechanism for this?) and reads the primary text to identify the alert. The
    whole point for removing the title is that its redundant with the primary
    text, and puts more crap on the screen to be read. This problem applies
    double to users with screenreaders (i.e. reducing extra crap helps them
    even more). -Seth</remark>

    <remark>An alert still needs to have an appropriate accessible description
    (perhaps the primary text of the alert itself?), so a screenreader user
    hears some information about its content when they focus it. -Calum</remark>

    <!--<remark>FIXME: need to finish this section</remark>-->

    <para>An assistant is a secondary window that guides the user through an
    operation by breaking it into sequential steps. Assistants are useful for
    making complex operations less intimidating, as they restrict the
    information visible to the user at any given moment.</para>

    <para>Because assistants provide a relatively small number of controls on
    the screen at any given time, they have sufficient space for inline
    documentation. Therefore, do not include a <guibutton>Help</guibutton>
    button in an assistant window. If you cannot make an operation
    sufficiently clear in an assistant without resorting to a
    <guibutton>Help</guibutton> button, you need to simplify it further.</para>

    <para revisionflag="added">Assistants do have major downsides. After using an assistant
    it is often hard to figure out where the individual settings aggregated
    into the assistant are stored. Often people will resort to re-running
    the assistant, re-entering many settings that they don't want to change.

  <!-- Notes from GJM:
  Text-on-the-side toolbars are now part of Gtk+.
  Stock items have mnemonics/access keys. I don't think they should.
  -->
    

  <!-- CB-Fig: The four figures of the toolbars in rapid succession right at the beginning of the chapter is a little overwhelming, and possibly useless before the user reads anything about these.  Perhaps save them for later, when each type is discussed, or more details are given about toolbars so that the figures actually demonstrate something more than variety.  -->
  <!-- CFB: Assuming for now therefore that we ought to be recommending Gtk toolbars, but trying to keep the text as widget-neutral as possible
  <note>
  <title>For discussion</title>
  <para>A few people only want to recommend one type of toolbar.  Which should it be?  We can't really recommend the GAL one because it's not part of core GNOME.  On the other hand, the Gtk one is somewhat clunky, and projects like Evo, AbiWord etc. are unlikely to switch to it anyime soon.</para>
  </note>
  -->
    
  <para>Careful and consistent toolbar design speeds up the user's task by giving direct access to functions that would otherwise be hidden on a menu.  Use them only for the most important functions, however.  Having too many toolbar controls reduces their efficiency by making them harder to find, and too many rows of toolbars reduces the amount of screen space available to the rest of the application.</para>
    
  <sect1 id="toolbars-appearance">
    <title>Appearance and Content</title>
      
    <para>The effectiveness of toolbars is increased by maintaining a level of consistency between different applications.  The toolbar is one of the first parts of your application that a user will see the first time they run it, so by providing a toolbar that looks familiar to them, you can immediately make them feel comfortable about using your application.</para>
      
    <para>As well as following the recommendations and examples given in this section, look at the toolbars in other well-designed GNOME 2.0 applications for guidance when deciding what— and what not— to put on your application's toolbar.</para>
      
    <para>However many toolbars or <link linkend="toolbox-windows">toolbox windows</link> your application offers, provide one main toolbar by default that contains a representative subset of the application's overall functionality.  Many of the buttons on this toolbar will be the same regardless of the type of application.</para>
      
    <para>For example, the main toolbar in an office application will nearly always have <guilabel>New</guilabel>, <guilabel>Open</guilabel> and <guilabel>Save</guilabel> as its first three toolbar buttons.  Similarly, the first few buttons in a browser application should always include <guilabel>Back</guilabel>, <guilabel>Forward</guilabel>, <guilabel>Stop</guilabel> and <guilabel>Reload</guilabel>, in that order.</para>

    <title>Using Controls Effectively</title>

    <para>GNOME provides a set of controls, also known as widgets, which allow
    users to interact with your applications. Using these controls
    appropriately and not altering their standard behavior is important. This
    allows users to predict the effects of their actions, and thus learn to
    use your application more quickly and efficiently. Controls that behave in
    non-standard ways break the user's mental model of how your
    application works, and dilute the meaning of the interface's visual
    language.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="controls-terminology">
    <title>Terminology</title>

    <para>Although they are known as "widgets" in the GNOME APIs and
    developer documentation, do not use this term in your user interface or
    user documentation. Refer to them by their specific names (for example,
    "buttons" or "menus"), or by the generic name
    "controls".</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="controls-sensitivity">
    <title>Sensitivity</title>

    <!--      <remark>Do we really want to include GTK calls here? -Seth</remark> -->

    <!--	 CFB have removed the GTK calls for the basic stuff, although left it in for the 
		 more obscure things that hackers currently aren't doing -->

    <para>Sometimes it does not make sense to allow the user to interact with
    a control in the current context, for example, to press a
    <guilabel>Paste</guilabel> button when the clipboard is empty. At these
    times, make the control insensitive <!--(for example, using the <ulink url="http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/2.0/gtk/gtkwidget.html#GTK-WIDGET-SET-SENSITIVE"><function>gtk_widget_set_sensitive()</function></ulink> function, for GTK controls)-->
    to minimize the risk of user error. While a control is insensitive, it
    will appear dimmed and will not be able to receive the focus, although
    assistive technologies like screenreaders will still be able to detect and
    report it.</para>

    <para>It is usually better to make a control insensitive than to hide it
    altogether. This way, the user can learn about functionality they may be
    able to use later, even if it is not available right now.</para>

    <!--
      <para>Sometimes, however, a large group of controls always become insensitive or sensitive simultaneously as the direct result of user action, such as checking a box or pressing a button.  In this case it is sometimes better to hide or show the controls (for example, using the <ulink url="http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/2.0/gtk/gtkwidget.html#GTK-WIDGET-SHOW"><function>gtk_widget_show()</function></ulink> and <ulink url="http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/2.0/gtk/gtkwidget.html#GTK-WIDGET-HIDE"><function> gtk_widget_hide()</function></ulink> functions, for GTK controls) rather than making them sensitive or insensitive.  For example, if all the controls on a <link linkend="controls-notebooks">notebook tab</link> are insensitive, it is usually better to hide the tab altogether.</para>
-->

    <!-- CB-Ed: Hmm. Not sure about the preceding paragraph and the suggestion it makes.  Usually you don't want to change an interface as drastically as removing an entire tab when a user clicks a button - it's jarring, first of all, and secondly, you want to keep the UI as consistent as possible: one of the reasons for disabling, say, a menu item, and not just making it disappear when it is unavailable, is to train the user's eye and behavior to know where certain things are located. You may want to back this up or verify the suggestion's strength before finalizing the HIG. -->

    <sect2 id="controls-locked">
      <title>Locked Controls</title>

      <para>In a network-managed environment, like a computer lab, system
      administrators usually want to "lock down" the values of certain
      settings, or remove them from the user interface altogether. This makes
      it easier for them to troubleshoot any problems that their users may
      encounter. In GNOME, the correct way for the system administrator to do
      this is by restricting write access to the GConf keys corresponding to
      those settings.</para>

      <para>When you are designing your application, consider which settings a
      system administrator might want to make unavailable to users. These may
      typically include:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Settings that, if set wrongly, could prevent the application
          from functioning at all. For example, proxy settings in a network
          application.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Settings that could refer to networked resources. For example,
          the Templates directory in an office application, where shared
          stationery such as fax cover sheets might be stored.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Settings that customize the user interface, other than those
          required for accessibility. For example, certain menu, keyboard or
          toolbar customization options.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Your application needs to decide every time these controls are
      displayed whether or not they are available for editing, depending on
      the writeable state of the GConf key that holds its value. In the
      simplest case, your code for each control could look like that in the
      example below.</para>

      <!-- CB-Ed: Again, reconsider who your readers are.  Some may not be comfortable with terms such as "runtime."  Use language that is more inclusive; you may reword the first sentence to say "...decide when you start up your machine whether..." or something along those lines. -->

      <example>
        <title>Sample code fragment showing how to make a GConf-locked control
        insensitive</title>

        <programlisting revisionflag="changed">if (!gconf_key_is_writable (http_proxy))
        gtk_widget_set_sensitive (http_proxy_field, FALSE);</programlisting>
      </example>

      <para>Include a section for system administrators in your user guide,
      explaining which settings they can lock, and their corresponding GConf
      keys.</para>

      <para>Explain to the user why these controls cannot be edited at this
      time. You can do this with static text, tooltips or online help,
      depending on the situation. For example:</para>

      those entry fields to FALSE. Pressing <keycap>Return</keycap> should
      then move focus on to the next control instead. <!-- CB-Ed: Do you have data to back up the previous suggestion?  My first instinct would be to press TAB to go to the next entry field, not RETURN. -->
      <!-- CFB: yes, we had numerous emails while discussing this on the mailing lists to suggest that novice users in particular tend to press Return rather than Tab while form-filling -->
      Doing this will help prevent the user from accidentally closing the
      window before they have entered all the information they wanted to.</para>

      <para>As a further safeguard, remember not to set the default button in
      a dialog until the minimum amount of required information has been
      entered, for example, both a username and a password in a login dialog.
      Again, in this case you should move focus to the next control when the
      user presses <keycap>Return</keycap>, rather than just ignoring the
      keypress.</para>

      <para>If you need to provide a keyboard shortcut that activates the
      default button while a GtkTextView control has focus, use
      <keycombo><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>Return</keycap></keycombo>.</para>

        <para>Gtk does not currently move focus to the next control when
        <keycap>Return</keycap> is pressed and either <function>activates-default=FALSE</function>,
        or there is no default button in the window. For now,
        <keycap>Return</keycap> does nothing in these situations, so remember
        to implement the focus change behavior yourself.</para>

      <para>Normally, pressing <keycap>Tab</keycap> in a single-line entry

    <title>Frames and Separators</title>

    <para>A frame is a box with a title that you can draw around controls to
    organise them into functional groups. A separator is a single horizontal
    or vertical line that you can use to divide windows into functional
    groups.</para>

    <para>Frames with a border around their perimeter have traditionally been
    used for denoting groups of related controls. This is advantageous because
    it physically seperates disimilar controls, and also avoids repitition of
    the frame's label in individual member control labels. Unfortunately,
    they add visual noise that can both make a window appear more complex than
    it really is, and reduce the ability to quickly scan window elements.</para>

    <para>Rather than using bordered frames, use frames without borders, bold
    labels to make the categories stand out, and indented contents. This,
    combined with good layout and spacing, is usually a better alternative to
    bordered frames.</para>

    <para>Make each response delay in your application as short as possible,
    unless users need time to see the displayed information before it is
    erased. The acceptable response delay for each event is based on a typical
    user's sense that the event is a logical point at which to stop or
    pause. The greater that sense is, the more willingly the user will wait
    for a response. Verify that your application responds to users'
    requests within the limits listed in the table above. If your application
    cannot respond within those limits, it probably has one or more general
    problems caused by a particular algorithm or module.</para>

    <para>In the alert box that appears after pressing a
    <guibutton>Stop</guibutton> button, ensure the message and button labels
    in the alert box are specific and precise. Ambiguous button labels can
    cause users to terminate or continue a command unintentionally. For
    example, use:</para>

    <para><screen>Continue deleting files? <guibutton>[Continue Deleting]</guibutton>
    <guibutton>[Stop Deleting]</guibutton></screen></para>

    <para>rather than</para>

    <para><screen>Operation interrupted, continue? <guibutton>[Yes]</guibutton>
    <guibutton>[No]</guibutton></screen></para>

    <para>since in the latter example, it is not clear whether pressing
    <guibutton>Yes</guibutton> would continue the operation or continue the
    interruption (i.e. cancel the operation).</para>

  <title>Visual Design</title>

  <para>Visual design is not just about making your application look pretty.  Good visual design is about communication.  A well-designed application will make it easy for the user to understand the information that is being presented, and show them clearly how they can interact with that information.  If you can achieve all that, your application <emphasis>will</emphasis> look good to the user, even if it doesn't have any fancy graphics or spinning logos!</para>

    <title>Color</title>

    <para revisionflag="changed">Color is a good tool for communicating information in a user interface. For example, it can be used to:</para>

      <listitem><para>strengthen a desktop's look and feel by enhancing a theme</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>accent a dynamic alert in a system management application</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>add aesthetically pleasing details to an icon</para></listitem>

    <para revisionflag="changed">However, color should always be regarded as a useful addition to your design, not as a necessity. Never depend upon colors alone to display important information, and keep in mind that if colors cannot be perceived correctly (for example, the user has an 8-bit system, or is color-blind), your application should still be usable. </para>

      <para>A 32-color palette has been developed for the GNOME desktop. The palette may be downloaded from <ulink url="http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gup/images/ximian-palette">http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gup/images/ximian-palette</ulink>. To use it in The GIMP, save it to your <filename>~/.gimp_1.2/palettes</filename><phrase revisionflag="changed"> folder, and restart The GIMP. A single, consistently-used palette helps give a unified look and feel to the desktop while minimizing visual distractions. If you need a color that is darker or lighter than the colors in this basic palette (e.g., for anti-aliasing), choose a color that is closest to the hue you need, then darken or lighten as required.</phrase></para>

      <para>Other users have more problems with contrast levels rather than hue on their screen. Some users require a high level of contrast between background and foreground colors, such as black on white, white on black, or some other high-contrast combination. Others can experience discomfort unless they use low-contrast settings, such as gray text on a lighter gray background.</para>

      <para>You can meet these needs by ensuring your application supports the accessible GNOME themes (found in the gnome-themes module in cvs), which include high and low contrast themes, and large print themes. This means you must supply default and large sizes of high-, low- and regular-contrast icon sets with your application. <!--See <xref linkend=""/> for information on how to design these icons.--></para>

	<listitem><para>Ensure your application is not dependent on a particular theme.

      <para>In <xref linkend="improved-layout-figure"/>, the dialog on the left presents labels which are not left-aligned. The user's eye is not given a proper anchor to scan the dialog quickly.</para>

      <para>As the labels are all similar in length, they should be left-aligned. Now the user has a firm left margin to anchor the eye and scan the list of items vertically more easily. If most of the labels in a group greatly differ in length, right-align them instead, so that the controls do not end up too far away from their corresponding labels.</para>

      <para>Using frames with visible borders to separate groups within a window is deprecated. Use spacing and bold headers instead. This is more effective because there are fewer gratuitous lines to distract the user from the main content in the window. See <xref linkend="controls-frames"/> for more details.</para>

      <para>Try to keep components consonant with each other in terms of size and alignment. This is particularly important within a group of controls, so that the user's ability to quickly scan information is not sacrificed.  Minimize as much as possible the need for the user's eye to jump around when scanning a layout.</para>

To a visually-impaired user who may not be able to see or understand any additional graphical output, clear textual output is critical.

    <title>Fonts</title>
    <para>Only use the fonts that the user has specified in their theme, and in sizes relative to the default size specified in their theme.  This will ensure maximum legibility and accessibility for all users.</para>
    <para>Do not mix more than two or three font sizes and styles (underlined, bold, italicized) in one window, as this will look unprofessional and distract the user from the information being conveyed.</para>
    <para>Provide alternatives to WYSIWYG where applicable. Some users may need to print text in a small font but edit in a larger screen font, for example. Possible alternatives include displaying all text in the same font and size (both of which are chosen by the user); a "wrap-to-window" option that allows you to read all the text in a window without scrolling horizontally; a single column view that shows the window's contents in a single column even if they will be printed in multiple columns; and a text-only view, where graphics are shown as placeholders or text descriptions.</para>

  <title>Icons</title>
  <para>Icons are a graphical metaphor presenting a visual image that the user associates with a particular object, state or operation. When a user sees a good icon they are immediately reminded of the item it represents, whether that be an application in the panel menu or the "right aligned" state in a word processor toolbar.</para>
  <para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para>Icons can assist the user in rapidly scanning a large number of objects to select the desired item. Particularly after a user is acustomed to an icon's appearance, they can identify it more rapidly than a text label.</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>Icons can augment text by providing visual suggestions to accompany the descriptive text. Some things are easier to communicate with a picture, even a very small one.</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>Icons can compactly represent a large number of objects when there is insufficient space to display textual descriptions (such as in a toolbar).</para></listitem>

  </para>

  <sect1 id="icons-style">
    <title>Style</title>
    
    <para>GNOME uses a soft, three-dimensional look. This style is achieved by using antialiasing, shading and highlighting techniques. The <ulink url="http://developer.ximian.com/articles/tutorials/icons/"><citetitle>Gnome Icons</citetitle></ulink> tutorial details how one of GNOME's leading artists creates some of these effects.</para>
    <para>Components of an icon style can be broken down into several categories such as perspective, dimentionality, lighting effects and palette. These components play an important part in giving a group of icons a collectively distinctive look. For instance, the Java Look and Feel is recognizable by its use of a primary eight-color palette, interior highlighting and diagonal gradients. The Macintosh Aqua style is recognizable by its use of a cool palette based on blue, lighting effects mimicking reflectivity and antialiasing. The GNOME style exhibits a subdued thirty-two color palette, soft drop shadows and a mix between cartoonish and photorealistic graphics.</para>

      <title>Document Icons</title>
      <para>If possible, document icons should convey the type of the file using a physical object. For example a good icon for MPEG video would be a movie reel. Failing the existence of an appropriate object, when a document type corresponds to a specific application, another option is to use a piece of paper with the corresponding application's icon overlayed it as the document icon. This may be appropriate for a document type such as an application's settings files.</para>
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para>Do <emphasis>not</emphasis> display a piece of paper behind a document icon unless the document type has a use correspondence with physical paper (or a suitable object was not found and you are using the application icon). For example, the final state of most word processing documents is a piece of paper, so it is appropriate to use a piece of paper in the icon. On the other hand, a movie on the computer has little association with a piece of paper, so a piece of paper behind the movie reel primarily introduces <link linkend="icon_problems_extraneous_information">visual noise</link>. The use of a piece of paper in most or all document types creates an additional problem: it is harder to scan large numbers of icons because they do not possess <link linkend="icon_design_silhouettes">distinct outlines</link>. A useful technique for creating a subtle difference between document types with similar roles (for example, between "JPEG", "PNG", "GIF", etc) is to use different colours. Expert users who need to make this distinction frequently will become accustomed to these differences.</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>Do <emphasis>not</emphasis> include a file extension in the icon. The document icon's job is not to convey such precise information but to allow for rapid visual distinction between documents. Additionally, this text will not be displayed in the user's preferred font and size. Because many document types are associated with multiple file extensions, a file extension embedded in the icon will also frequently be wrong. In a context where the file extension is actually useful, the application should composite the information onto the icon at runtime (thereby using the correct font and size, as well as getting the extension right).</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>Do <emphasis>not</emphasis> customize document icons to a particular Nautilus theme. Document icons are likely to be used in conjunction with a variety of different icon themes, and should work well with all of them.</para></listitem>

Do not use stock toolbar icons for anything other than their intended purpose, however, as this will make your application inconsistent with others, and could easily confuse your users.</para>

	  <title>Make Icon Silhouettes Distinct</title>
	  <para>It is important to make it easy to visually distinguish icons that will be used together, for example toolbar icons and document icons. The human visual system is excellent at making rapid distinctions between items based on shape, thus a good way to help your users sort through a large number of icons is to use different shapes. You can see the shape of an icon most clearly by turning it into a silhouette: blacken all areas of the icon which are not transparent.</para>

    <!-- CB-Ed: Much of this section has good substance, but is communicated poorly.  There seem to be a lot of blanket statements, and the tone is subjective (e.g., text describing figure 12, the Gnumeric icon.  Stick just to the facts, or try to stay closely to objective language, and language that will not be presenting things in a way that can be argued with or questioned. -->
    <!-- Seth: Objective language does not present the entire picture. While its better for laying down hard and fast guidelines, it does not assist designers in understanding the motivation behind various decisions. This document covers the design *philosophy* as well as providing specific guidelines. This is in fact one of my major complaints about the Java guidelines relative to the MacOS guidelines. Java guidelines attempt to maintain a facade of scientific objectivity and in doing so fail to educate designers as well as failing to communicate the real dynamics of good design. Dealing with more subjective issues is particularly important because many of the readers of the GNOME guidelines will not be professional icon artists, or even graphic designers. -->

	    <title>Avoid name suggestive icons</title>
	    <para>Some icons, such as the Nautilus icon, do not suggest the program's purpose, but instead suggest the program's name. This is less desirable than a functionally suggestive icon, because an extra layer of abstraction is added (rather than associating file management with an icon representing files, they have to associate file management with nautilus with an image of a nautilus shell). Additionally it makes it difficult for new users who may not know what "Nautilus" is, and hence will not recognize a shell icon as the file manager.</para>

	    <title>Do <emphasis>not</emphasis> include meaningful text in icons</title>
	    <para>Icons which contain the text of the program name in the icon. They effectively contain no metaphor or picture for the user to identify with, and are probably harder to read than the accompanying caption. Since icons draw the eyes, an icon that is harder to identify than text is potentially worse than no icon at all. Hence "text icons" should not be used. Moreover, text should be avoided in icons because it makes the icons difficult to translate. If there is text in icons it should not form words in your native language, a good metric for ensuring that the particular text is not lending to the meaning of the icon.</para>

	    <title>Do <emphasis>not</emphasis> include extraneous information</title>
	    <para revisionflag="changed">Remember that icons will often be viewed in a smaller form. Too much information may render the icon unintelligible when it is shrunk in size (e.g. to be placed on a panel, or in the tasklist). Too much information also makes it easier for users confuse the purpose of the application. For example, in user testing many users thought the Evolution icon would launch a word processor. They were misled by the pencil and the paper, which could be seen as extraneous information: it is implicit that the mail program will allow you to write messages as well as receive them. A better icon might have been a simple envelope. Foremost in the icon designer's mind should be a consideration of the minimal visual elements necessary to express the purpose of the program.</para>

	  <para>
	    The Gnumeric icon is a great icon except for the introduction of extra visual noise. The extra sheet of paper with the 'g' on it behind the spreadsheet and chart adds no significant value to the icon and provides extra visual distraction. In this case the contribution of the extraneous element to the appearance of the icon is negative. Simple well balanced icons look more attractive than cluttered icons. An improved icon might contain only the spreadsheet and chart; larger because they can use all of the space in the icon, and hence more visually distinct.

	    <title>Do <emphasis>not</emphasis> include body parts in the icon</title>
	    <para> Because GNOME aims to be an international desktop, it needs to avoid imagery that is potentially offensive or crass to other cultures. A prime source of offensive imagery is various body parts in a number of different configurations. Aside from offensive gestures with the hands, arms or fingers; body parts that are considered "clean" in one culture (such as eyes), will be considered tasteless or gross to another (such as a nose). Based on a survey of icons in GNOME, body parts frequently appear in the least communicative icons (often "pointing" at some element in the icon); they are being used as an ineffective crutch for poor metaphor. In these situations body parts should <emphasis>not</emphasis> be used. Even in situations where the metaphor is appropriate (for example an eye representing the sawfish appearance capplet) it is better to avoid using a body part. Often body parts have been used in GNOME to suggest a human "choosing" or "using" something. This is normally an unnecessary point for the icon designer to make. People naturally attempt to understand objects in reference to themselves (show someone a bat and they will think of hitting something with the bat, show someone a tool and they will think of using it, etc). For example, the font selector shows a finger pointing to an "F" suggesting the user choosing between a series of fonts. A better icon would be the text "Aa" presented in an ornate font (calling attention to the font rather than the text). The user doesn't need to be told that they are "choosing" the font, they can infer that easily.</para>

	    <title>Do <emphasis>not</emphasis> base icons off word puns</title>
	      <para>This should be avoided for a couple reasons, the most obvious of which is that puns do not translate well. For example, representing the "system log monitor" as a log will likely be uncommunicative in languages other than English. Additionally, most users do not comprehend the word play until it is too late for the icon to assist them. Even after being familiar with the "system log monitor" being represented as a log, users do not form the association fast enough for the icon to assist through in scanning through menu entries. A popular instance of this problem was the proliferation of icons representing the "World Wide Web" as a spider web in the mid 1990s. Part of the value of icons is that they bypass linguistic comprehension and hence are complementary to captions, allowing users to utilize more areas of the mind than linguistic recognition (already used in scanning for captions) when they hunt for items.</para>

	    <para>Just as words like "kill" and "slay" are inappropriate in interfaces, violent or destructive icons should be avoided. The "shut down" icon uses the image of an explosive detonation switch, presumably trying to convey the idea of ending something abruptly. However, this icon is likely to intimidate some users of the computer who will not want to click on the icon for fear of breaking something.</para>

	<para>A well-designed keyboard user interface plays a key role when you are designing applications. Many power-users prefer to perform most operations with the keyboard rather than the mouse. Visually-impaired users can navigate software more effectively using the keyboard, because using the mouse depends on visual feedback of the mouse pointer location. And mobility impairments can prevent a user from successfully navigating using the mouse, because of the fine motor control skills required.</para>

	<para>Most functionality is easy to make available from the keyboard, by using access keys and shortcut keys, and the toolkit's built-in keyboard navigation features. All controls with labels should have access keys, and frequently-used menu items should be assigned shortcut keys. However, operations that rely on drag-and-drop, for example, may require more thought to make them keyboard accessible.</para>
		
	<itemizedlist><title>Guidelines</title>
	  
	  <listitem><para revisionflag="changed">Provide efficient keyboard access to all application features. In particular, ensure every control on menus and in dialogs are directly focusable using access keys or shortcut keys.</para></listitem>
	  
	  <listitem><para>Use a logical keyboard navigation order. When navigating around a window with the Tab key, keyboard focus should move between controls in a predictable order.  In Western locales, this is normally left to right and top to bottom.</para></listitem>
	  
	  <listitem><para><phrase revisionflag="changed">Ensure correct tab order for controls whose enabled state is dependent on check box, radio button or toggle button state. When such a button is selected, all its dependent controls should be enabled, and all the dependent controls of any other button in the group should be disabled. When the user selects a check box, radio button or toggle button that has dependent controls, do not automatically give focus to the first dependent control, but instead leave the focus on the button.

	  <listitem><para>Do not over-ride existing system-level accessibility features. For example, the MouseKeys feature in the GNOME <guilabel>Keyboard Accessibility</guilabel> preferences dialog allows mouse movement and button clicks to be simulated using the keypad. Therefore you cannot add features to your application that can only be accessed by pressing keys on the keypad, as users relying on the MouseKeys feature will not be able to use them.</para></listitem>
	  
	  <listitem><para>Ensure that any text that can be selected with the mouse can also be selected with the keyboard.  This is a convenience for all users, but especially for those for whom fine control of the mouse is difficult.</para></listitem>
	  
	  <listitem><para>Ensure that objects that can be resized or moved by drag and drop can also be resized or moved with the keyboard. For example, icons and windows on the desktop. Where precision sizing and placement is potentially important, e.g. shapes in a diagram, also consider providing a dialog into which you can type co-ordinates, or a means of snapping objects to a user-definable grid.</para></listitem>

	  <listitem><para>Do not assign awkward reaches to frequently performed keyboard operations. Some people may only be able to use one hand on the keyboard, so shortcuts that can be easily used with one hand are preferable for common operations.  In any case, having to frequently perform long or difficult reaches on the keyboard can increase muscle strain for all users, increasing the risk of pain or injury.</para></listitem>
	  
	  <listitem><para>Do not require repetitive use of simultaneous keypresses. Some users are only able to press and hold one key at a time. Assistive technologies such as the GNOME <guilabel>Keyboard Accessibility</guilabel> preferences dialog do allow users to press the keys sequentially rather than simultaneously, but this of course means the operation will take longer for them.</para></listitem>

	  <remark>The point about not having Tab initiate any actions effectively rules out tab completion in dialogs, should we consider/recommend a "hands-free" auto-completion method instead, as offered by OpenOffice.org, Explorer etc.?  What does our new 2.0 file selection dialog do?</remark>

<!-- Consensus was against giving OK and Cancel additional access keys, but they have them anyway and Owen refuses to remove them...

	<note>
	  <title>For discussion</title>
	  <para>It's been suggested that even OK and Cancel should have access keys, as this is more obvious to newer users.  (KDE does this).  What do we think?  Advantages: means you do not always have to have an Enter-operated default button in dialogs where this might lead you to close the dialog by mistake.  Disadvantages: Adds an extra way for people to do things, potentially adding the "dither" factor; uses up O and C access keys, which could be awkward in larger/tabbed dialogs.</para>

	  <listitem><para>Use the first letter of the label, or of one of its other words if it has more than one.  If another letter provides a better association (e.g. "x" in <guilabel>Extra Large</guilabel>) however, consider using that letter instead.</para></listitem>

	<title>Choosing Shortcut Keys</title>

	<para>The tables in <xref linkend="standard-shortcuts"/> summarize the standard shortcut keys to use when your application supports those functions.  Your application will not necessarily support all of these functions, see <xref linkend="menus-standard"/> for more information.  However, use the recommended shortcut keys for those functions you do support.</para> 

	<para>You will probably want to add your own shortcut keys for functions specific to your application.  If so, as well as following the guidelines below, look at any other existing similar applications to see which shortcut keys they have defined.  Your users may already be using those or similar applications, so being consistent where it is possible and sensible to do so will provide a better user experience for them when they begin to use yours.</para>

	<itemizedlist><title>Guidelines</title>

	  <listitem><para>Use <keycombo><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keysym>letter</keysym></keycombo> in preference to other combinations when choosing new shortcut keys.</para></listitem>

Do not assign them to unrelated functions just because you've run out of other shortcut key combinations, however.</para></listitem>

	  <listitem><para>Only assign shortcut keys to the most commonly-used actions in your application.  Do not try to assign a shortcut key to everything.</para></listitem>

	  <listitem><para>Choose new shortcut keys to be as mnemonic as possible, as these will be easier to learn and remember.  For example, <keycombo><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>E</keycap></keycombo> would be a good shortcut for a menu item called <guimenuitem>Edit Page</guimenuitem>.</para></listitem>

	  <listitem><para>Use <keycombo><keycap>Shift</keycap><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>letter</keycap></keycombo> for functions that reverse or extend another function.

	<title>Keyboard Interaction with Panel Applications (Applets)</title>

	<para>Panels have been fully keyboard navigable since GNOME 2.0.  Since your panel application can gain keyboard focus, you must ensure that it is also keyboard navigable.</para>

	<para>The rules for panel application keyboard navigation are mostly the same as those for any other window.  However, there is one imporant difference:</para>

	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem><para>Do <emphasis>not</emphasis> use the the <keycap>Tab</keycap> key as the means of moving focus between controls in a panel application.  Use the arrow keys for this purpose instead.</para></listitem>
	</itemizedlist>

	<para>When an object on a panel has focus, the <keycap>Tab</keycap> key normally moves focus to the next object on the panel.  If your panel application also used <keycap>Tab</keycap> for its own internal navigation, the user would have to press <keycombo><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>Tab</keycap></keycombo> to move focus out of your panel application instead.  This inconsistency would be detremental to the user experience.</para>

	<para>Include these user descriptions and scenarios with the documentation you commit to CVS.  This way, other contributors will get to understand your users too, can help to develop the application with that knowledge, and can provide more scenarios of their own.</para>

	<title> Keyboard Access and Focus</title>

	<para>When you have started implementing your interface, hide your mouse, and make sure you can still use it to do everything using only the keyboard. Implement keyboard functionality at the same time as mouse functionality— don't leave it until the end.</para>

<!-- CB: This is a non-figure comment, I couldn't help myself.  The first sentence in the paragraph directly above, is badly written.  The word "it" is ambiguous in the sentence because it likely refers to the mouse!  Please correct. -->

	<para>Using only keyboard commands, move the focus through all menu bars and toolbars in the application. Also confirm that:</para>
	
<!-- CB-Ed: OK I'll just make all non-figures comments tagged with CB-Ed.  The above paragraph should be part of the bulleted list below. -->

<!-- CB-Fig: All figures comments will be tagged with CB-Fig.  A single figure showing an example GUI with callouts highlighting bulleted points would be great. Perhaps visually box bulleted elements and then "zoom" them out with callout text.  -->

	<title>Theming, Colors and Contrast</title>

	<para>Test various GNOME themes to ensure that your application respects all the available settings.</para>

	<para>Test your application with black and white, high contrast themes and confirm that all information is still conveyed correctly.  If you don't have a suitable high contrast GNOME theme available to test, print off some screenshots in black and white (not greyscale) and make sure all the important information is still visible— this will approximate what a high contrast theme user will see.</para>

	<title>Animation</title>

	<para>Ensure you have implemented an option to turn off any animation in your application (for accessibility reasons), and that it is working as designed.  Turn the animation off. Confirm that all information is still conveyed correctly.</para>

	<title>Get Early Feedback</title>
	
	<para>It's always tempting, but don't start coding your interface straight away.  Sketch out some ideas on paper first, or in Glade or HTML if you prefer.  (But don't be tempted add any functionality at this point if you do it this way!)</para>

	<para>Show these prototypes to other people— the GNOME mailing lists and IRC are ideal for finding likely candidates.  Ask them to use these prototype interfaces to run through some of the scenarios you came up with earlier.  You'll probably get questions like "how would I do X", "which menu is Y on"... these questions will help you think about the interface from the user's viewpoint.  You'll probably also get a few suggestions about how to do things differently— these ideas may or may not turn out to better than yours, but any idea from a potential user is worth considering!</para>

	<para>You should also consider seeking opinions from the <ulink url="http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gup/">GNOME Usability team</ulink>.  They have designed many user interfaces before and may be able to spot potential problems at this early stage, before you take your design too far to change easily.</para>

	<para>Once you've decided on the basic interface design and have started coding parts of it, find somebody to try it out again— it doesn't have to be the same person.  You'll probably find some more problems that were hard to see on your static paper prototype.  By finding these now, it's usually not too late to fix them without too much trouble.</para>

      <sect2>
	<title>Internationalization and Localization</title>

	<para>If you intend your application to be translated into different languages, show draft designs of your application to the <ulink url="http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gtp/contact.html">GNOME Translation Team</ulink>.  They'll help you find potential translation problems, such as not leaving enough space for translated labels, shortcut keys that cause problems on a different keyboard layout, or using new terms in your app that are hard to translate.</para>

	<para>If possible, try out your application with users from the locales you are targeting.  This will help you determine whether users understand how to use the application, if they perceive the graphics and colors the way you intended, and if there are words or images in the application that may cause offence to users of that locale. </para>
