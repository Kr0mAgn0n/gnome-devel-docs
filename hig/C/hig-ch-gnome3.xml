    <title>Applicability to GNOME 3</title>
	<para>This version of the Human Interface Guidelines was written for designers 		and developers of GNOME 2 applications. This focus is reflected in the advice 
	offered, and in the accompanying illustrations.</para>

	<para>Since many of them apply equally to GNOME 3, however, you can and 
	should continue to follow the majority of these usability principles and
	guidelines in your GNOME 3 application.</para>

	<para>An updated Human Interface Guidelines document focusing on GNOME 3 
	will be released in due course. In the meantime, you can find some specific 
	GNOME 3 guidelines on the <ulink url="http://live.gnome.org/GnomeShell/Design/Guidelines">GNOME Shell Guidelines</ulink> wiki page.</para>
